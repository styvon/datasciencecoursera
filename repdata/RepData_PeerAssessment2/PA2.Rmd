**Synopsis:** This article takes a brief look into the weather influences on population health and economy accross the United States from 1950 to 2011 using the NOAA storm data. *Data Processing* Data is processed so that for each type of weather event, its health influence is estimated by total fatalities and injuries, and  economic consequence by total property and crop damage. *Results* 20 weather events causing the largest health and economic loss are listed respectively. For population health outcomes, tornados take first place of the list, causing a total of 96,979 people dead or injured across the country, followed by excessive heats (8,428), thunderstorm winds (7,461), floods (7,259) and lightnings (6,046). For economic loss, floods take first place of the list, causing a total of $150.3 billion USD loss across the country, followed by hurricane/typhoon ($71.9 billion USD), tornados ($57.4 billion USD), storm surges ($43.3 billion USD) and hails ($18.8 billion USD). *Discussion* Further analysis is to be conducted to investigate the characteristics of weather influences.
  
    
    
## Data Processing
1. The NOAA storm database raw data is retrieved from [here](https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/repdata%2Fdata%2FStormData.csv.bz2) and loaded into R. (the *readRDS* command line is used for fast reading if the object is already in the local directory.)
```{r load, cache=TRUE}
if(!file.exists("raw.RDS")) {
  url <- "https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/repdata%2Fdata%2FStormData.csv.bz2"
  download.file(url, "StormData.csv.bz2", method = "curl")
  raw <- read.table(file = "StormData.csv.bz2", header = T, sep = ",")
}
raw <- readRDS("raw.RDS")
```
  
  
2. Include variables that indicate: 1) types of events, 2) total number of fatalities for each event, 3) total number of injuries for each event, 4) total property damages for each event, 5) total crop damage for each event, 6) total economic damage, into a new data set.
```{r select, results="hide"}
library(dplyr, quietly= T)
df <- select(raw, EVTYPE, FATALITIES:CROPDMGEXP) 
```
  
  
3. Create a function that replace original elements (*ori*) in *x* with new values (*rep*).
```{r cleanexp}
cleanexp <- function(ori,rep,x) {
  output <- x
  for (i in 1:length(ori)) {
    for (j in seq_along(x)) {
      if (x[j] == ori[i]) {
        output[j] <- rep[i]
        }
      }
    }
  output
}
```
  
  
4. Substitute keys in PROPDMGEXP/CROPDMGEXP variables with values. Keys and values are listed in *Table 1*. 
```{r replace value, results='asis'}
orig <-unique(c(as.character(unique(df$PROPDMGEXP)),as.character(unique(df$CROPDMGEXP))))
repl <- c(10^3,10^6,1,10^9,10^6,1,1,10^5,10^6,1,10^4,10^2,10^3,10^2,10^7,10^2,1,10,10^8,10^3)
df$PROPDMGEXP <- as.numeric(cleanexp(orig, repl, as.character(df$PROPDMGEXP)))
df$CROPDMGEXP <- as.numeric(cleanexp(orig, repl, as.character(df$CROPDMGEXP)))
library(xtable, quietly= T)
table <- xtable(rbind(orig,repl))
print(table, type = "html")
```
Table 1. Original keys in variables PROPDMGEXP and CROPDMGEXP and the corresponding replacement values. 
  
  
5. Further data processing include: 1) calculating overall influence on population health, 2) calculating property damage and crop damage, 4) calculating overall economic loss, 5) unifying units of economic loss ($Million USD), 6) unifying variable names. Each numeric value in the processed data set represents the total number for each type of weather event.
```{r data process}
df <-
group_by(df, EVTYPE) %>%
mutate(HEALTH = FATALITIES + INJURIES, EPROP = PROPDMG * PROPDMGEXP/10^6, ECROP = CROPDMG * CROPDMGEXP/10^6, ECO = EPROP + ECROP) %>%
summarize(fatalities = sum(FATALITIES), injuries = sum(INJURIES), health = sum(HEALTH), eprop = sum(EPROP), ecrop = sum(ECROP), eco = sum(ECO)) 
names(df) <- tolower(names(df))
```

6. Gather variables in *df* and form a new data set (*hdata*) for evaluating influence on population health. 
```{r gatherhealth}
library(tidyr, quietly= T)
hdata <- gather(df[,-(4:7)], outcome, num, -evtype)
hdata$health <- rep(df$health,2)
```
Listed below are variables in *hdata* :
- evtype: types of event (evtype),
- outcome: types of health outcome (fatality/injury),
- num: number of people inflicted, and
- health: total number of fatality and injury for each event (health).

7. Gather variables in *df* and form a new data set (*edata*) for evaluating economic loss.
```{r}
edata <- gather(df[,c(1,5:6)], group, damage, -evtype)
edata$eco <- rep(df$eco,2)
```
  

## Results
### Exploring health outcomes
1. *Figure 1* is a stacked bar plot with types of events as y axis and health consequenses as x axis, types of events are ordered by total number of fatalities and injuries. Only the top 20 events are plotted.
```{r}
library(ggplot2, quietly= T)
htop <- df$evtype[which(rank(df$health) %in% 966:985)]
hdata2 <- hdata[hdata$evtype %in% htop,]
for (i in 1:nrow(hdata2)) {
  if (hdata2$outcome[i] =="fatalities"){
    hdata2$num[i] <- -hdata2$num[i]
  }
}
gh <- ggplot(hdata2, aes(x = reorder(evtype,health), y = num, fill = outcome))
gh + geom_bar(stat = "identity", position = "identity", width = 0.5) + 
     coord_flip() +
     xlab("Weather Events") +
     ylab("Number") +
     theme(legend.position="top") +
     ggtitle("Figure 1: Top 20 Weather Events  with Highest Fatalities & Injuries")
hrank <- arrange(hdata2, desc(health))
unique(hrank[,c(1,4)])
```

Tornados take first place of the list, causing a total of 96,979 people dead or injured across the country, followed by excessive heats (8,428), thunderstorm winds (7,461), floods (7,259) and lightnings (6,046). 
 
### Exploring economic consequences
*Figure 2* is a bar plot with types of events as y axis and economic consequenses as x axis. Only the top 20 events are plotted.
```{r}
etop <- df$evtype[which(rank(df$eco) %in% 966:985)]
edata2 <- edata[edata$evtype %in% etop,]
for (i in 1:nrow(edata2)) {
  if (edata2$group[i] =="ecrop"){
    edata2$damage[i] <- -edata2$damage[i]
  }
}
ge <- ggplot(edata2, aes(x=reorder(evtype,eco), y=damage, fill=group))
ge + geom_bar(stat = "identity", position = "identity", width = 0.5) + 
     coord_flip() +
     xlab("Weather Events") +
     ylab("Economic Loss ($M USD)") +
     theme(legend.position="top") +
     ggtitle("Figure 2: Top 20 Weather Events  Causing Largest Economic Loss")
erank <- arrange(edata2, desc(eco))
unique(erank[,c(1,4)])
```

Floods take first place of the list, causing a total of $150.3 billion USD loss across the country, followed by hurricane/typhoon ($71.9 billion USD), tornados ($57.4 billion USD), storm surges ($43.3 billion USD) and hails ($18.8 billion USD).  

  
## Discussion
1. As can be seen from *Figure 2*, damages to properties and crops are not evenly distributed. For example, while drought ranks sixth in total economic loss, it causes the largest crop damage of all weather events. 
2. Considering the complexity of the data, more characteristics can be extracted with further analysis conducted, including the change of weather influence across time, average damage caused by a single weather event etc.
